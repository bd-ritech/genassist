    Liveness heartbeat for the solo-pool worker.

    The solo pool runs tasks inline in the worker's main thread, so Celery's
    own control channel (``celery inspect ping``) cannot answer while a task is
    running — a healthy long task would look dead to an ``inspect ping`` probe.

    Instead we run a separate daemon thread that writes the current time to
    ``HEARTBEAT_FILE`` every ``HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS``. A k8s liveness
    probe checks that file's age (see deployment manifest). Because the task's
    async I/O releases the GIL while awaiting, this thread keeps ticking during
    a healthy long task, but stops if the process dies or hard-freezes — which
    is exactly what we want the probe to restart. (A task merely hung on the
    network is handled separately by the per-task asyncio.wait_for timeout.)
